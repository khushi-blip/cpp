basically in exp 3 of chem we will be given 3 bekears one will be 
1) dil sulphuric acid
2)n/30 unknowon sol
3)water sample

IN the burette we gotta fill upto 0 the n/30 sol , then the external 
indicator potassium ferricyanide k3[fe(cn6)] we gotta put drop
by drop in a piece of rough papaer the ferricyanide sol

take a beaker 10 ml how do we detect 10 ml the sign exactly below 
s mark
take 10 ml sol of water sample in 10 ml beaker
then put it in conical flask add very small amounts of
h2so4 dil one 
note: the h2so4 should be less in amt
then titrate it agaisnt the n/30 soln
cm by cm
the first color will be dark blue/greenish but we gotta achive yellow
